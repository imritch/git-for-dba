# Practice Scenarios - Learn by Doing

These are realistic scenarios you can practice to solidify your Git skills. Each scenario builds on the concepts from the lessons.

## 🎯 Scenario 1: The Friday Afternoon Disaster

**Situation:** It's Friday at 4:45 PM. You've been working on a complex stored procedure all afternoon with 12 commits. Code review is Monday morning. Your commit history looks like:

```
- WIP fixing bug
- still working
- almost there
- fixed typo
- another typo
- testing
- still testing
- removed debug code
- oops forgot semicolon
- fixing again
- I think this works
- Final version
```

**Task:** Clean this up into 2-3 professional commits before Monday.

**Solution Steps:**
```bash
# Use interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~12

# Squash related commits
# Reword commit messages to be professional
# Result: 
#   - "Implement GetCustomerReport procedure with date filtering"
#   - "Add error handling and performance optimization"
#   - "Add unit tests and documentation"
```

**Skills Practiced:** Interactive rebase, squashing, rewording

## 🎯 Scenario 2: The Wrong Branch Mistake

**Situation:** You just made 5 commits to `main` when you should have been working on a feature branch called `feature/new-indexes`.

**Task:** Move your commits to the correct branch without losing any work.

**Solution Steps:**
```bash
# Note the commits you made (get their hashes)
git log --oneline -5

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-indexes

# Go back to main
git checkout main

# Reset main to before your commits
git reset --hard HEAD~5

# Switch back to feature branch - your commits are there!
git checkout feature/new-indexes
```

**Alternative Solution (using cherry-pick):**
```bash
# From main, note commit hashes
git log --oneline -5

# Create feature branch from the correct point
git checkout -b feature/new-indexes HEAD~5

# Cherry-pick your commits
git cherry-pick <hash1> <hash2> <hash3> <hash4> <hash5>

# Reset main
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~5
```

**Skills Practiced:** Reset, branching, cherry-pick

## 🎯 Scenario 3: The Merge Conflict Nightmare

**Situation:** Two DBAs (you and a coworker) both modified the same stored procedure. You need to merge your changes.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create scenario
cat > database/ProcessOrders.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessOrders AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Orders;
END
EOF
git add database/ProcessOrders.sql
git commit -m "Base procedure"

# Your branch
git checkout -b your-changes
cat > database/ProcessOrders.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessOrders
    @StartDate DATE
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderId, OrderDate, Amount 
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE OrderDate >= @StartDate;
END
EOF
git commit -am "Add date filtering"

# Coworker's branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b coworker-changes
cat > database/ProcessOrders.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessOrders
    @CustomerId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderId, CustomerId, Amount 
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId;
END
EOF
git commit -am "Add customer filtering"

# Merge coworker to main
git checkout main
git merge coworker-changes

# Now merge your changes - CONFLICT!
git merge your-changes
```

**Task:** Resolve the conflict by keeping BOTH features.

**Solution:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessOrders
    @StartDate DATE = NULL,
    @CustomerId INT = NULL
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderId, CustomerId, OrderDate, Amount 
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE (@StartDate IS NULL OR OrderDate >= @StartDate)
      AND (@CustomerId IS NULL OR CustomerId = @CustomerId);
END
```

```bash
# Mark resolved and commit
git add database/ProcessOrders.sql
git commit -m "Merge: Add both date and customer filtering"
```

**Skills Practiced:** Merge conflict resolution, SQL logic

## 🎯 Scenario 4: The Hotfix Marathon

**Situation:** A critical security vulnerability was found in production. You fixed it on `main`. Now you need to apply it to three older release branches: `release/v1.0`, `release/v2.0`, and `release/v3.0`.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create release branches
git checkout -b release/v1.0
echo "Version 1.0" > version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Release 1.0"

git checkout main
git checkout -b release/v2.0
echo "Version 2.0" > version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Release 2.0"

git checkout main
git checkout -b release/v3.0
echo "Version 3.0" > version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Release 3.0"

# Create the security fix on main
git checkout main
cat > database/SecurityFix.sql << 'EOF'
-- FIX: SQL Injection vulnerability
CREATE PROCEDURE SafeLogin
    @Username NVARCHAR(50),
    @Password NVARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Now using parameters instead of dynamic SQL
    SELECT UserId FROM Users 
    WHERE Username = @Username 
      AND PasswordHash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', @Password);
END
EOF
git add database/SecurityFix.sql
git commit -m "SECURITY: Fix SQL injection in login procedure"
```

**Task:** Apply this fix to all three release branches.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get the fix commit hash
FIX_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Apply to each release
git checkout release/v1.0
git cherry-pick $FIX_HASH

git checkout release/v2.0
git cherry-pick $FIX_HASH

git checkout release/v3.0
git cherry-pick $FIX_HASH

# Verify all branches have the fix
for branch in main release/v1.0 release/v2.0 release/v3.0; do
    echo "=== $branch ==="
    git checkout $branch
    git log --oneline -1
done
```

**Skills Practiced:** Cherry-pick, hotfix workflow

---

## 🎯 Scenario 5: The Stash Stack

**Situation:** You're working on feature A when you get pulled into feature B, then an urgent bug fix, then back to feature A.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Start feature A
git checkout -b feature/A
echo "Feature A work" > featureA.sql
git add featureA.sql
# Don't commit yet - urgent interruption!
```

**Task:** Manage multiple context switches without losing work.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Save feature A work
git stash save "Feature A: In progress"

# Work on feature B
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/B
echo "Feature B" > featureB.sql
git add featureB.sql
# Another interruption!

# Save feature B work
git stash save "Feature B: In progress"

# Urgent bug fix
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent
echo "Bug fix" > bugfix.sql
git add bugfix.sql
git commit -m "URGENT: Fix production bug"

# Merge hotfix
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/urgent

# Back to feature B
git checkout feature/B
git stash list  # See your stashes
git stash apply stash@{0}  # "Feature B: In progress"
# Complete feature B
git commit -m "Complete feature B"

# Back to feature A
git checkout feature/A
git stash apply stash@{1}  # "Feature A: In progress"
# Complete feature A
git commit -m "Complete feature A"

# Clean up stashes
git stash clear
```

**Skills Practiced:** Stash, context switching

---

## 🎯 Scenario 6: The Accidental Force Push

**Situation:** You accidentally reset main and force-pushed, erasing 5 commits that your team had already pulled.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create commits
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Commit $i" > file$i.sql
    git add file$i.sql
    git commit -m "Commit $i"
done

# Oops! Accidentally reset and force push
git reset --hard HEAD~5
# In real life: git push --force
```

**Task:** Recover the lost commits.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check reflog
git reflog

# Find the commit before the reset
# Look for: abc123 HEAD@{1}: commit: Commit 5

# Recover
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}

# Or if you know the commit hash
git reset --hard <hash-of-commit-5>

# Verify
git log --oneline

# If you really did force push, notify team:
# git push --force
# And tell them to: git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
```

**Skills Practiced:** Reflog, recovery

---

## 🎯 Scenario 7: The Rebase Cleanup

**Situation:** Your feature branch is 2 weeks old. Main has moved forward with 50 commits. Your branch has 20 messy commits.

**Task:** Bring your branch up to date and clean up your history.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Simulate old feature branch
git checkout -b feature/old-work

# Make messy commits
for i in {1..20}; do
    echo "Change $i" >> mywork.sql
    git add mywork.sql
    git commit -m "WIP $i"
done

# Simulate main moving forward
git checkout main
for i in {1..50}; do
    echo "Main change $i" > main-file-$i.sql
    git add main-file-$i.sql
    git commit -m "Main: Change $i"
done
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# First, rebase onto latest main
git checkout feature/old-work
git rebase main
# Resolve any conflicts

# Then, clean up your commits
git rebase -i main

# In the editor, squash your 20 commits into 3-5 logical commits
# pick for first commit of each logical group
# squash for the rest

# Force push your cleaned branch (safe on feature branches)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/old-work
```

**Skills Practiced:** Rebase, interactive rebase, squashing

---

## 🎯 Scenario 8: The Deployment Rollback

**Situation:** You deployed a change to production (committed and pushed to main). It's causing issues. You need to rollback immediately.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Good state
cat > database/Procedure.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE PROCEDURE GetData AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM GoodTable;
END
EOF
git add database/Procedure.sql
git commit -m "Working procedure"

# Bad deployment
cat > database/Procedure.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE PROCEDURE GetData AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM BadTable;  -- This table doesn't exist!
END
EOF
git commit -am "DEPLOYED: Update procedure"
git push origin main
```

**Task:** Rollback the deployment safely.

**Solution (Correct way - revert):**
```bash
# Revert the bad commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Now production has:
# Commit 3: Revert "DEPLOYED: Update procedure"
# Commit 2: DEPLOYED: Update procedure
# Commit 1: Working procedure

# Procedure is back to working state
```

**Solution (Wrong way - never do this):**
```bash
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main
# This will cause problems for everyone who pulled the bad commit
```

**Skills Practiced:** Revert, safe rollback practices
