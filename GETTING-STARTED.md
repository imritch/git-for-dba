# Getting Started - Your First Steps

Welcome! Let's get you started with practical Git exercises right away.

## âœ… Initial Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Git Aliases (Optional but Recommended)

Run the provided alias script to set up helpful shortcuts:

```bash
cd /Users/riteshchawla/RC/git/git-for-dba
chmod +x scripts/git-aliases.sh
./scripts/git-aliases.sh
```

This gives you handy commands like `git lg` (pretty log), `git undo`, `git amend`, etc.

### 2. Configure Git (If not already done)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Optional: Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # For VS Code
# or
git config --global core.editor "vim"  # For Vim
```

### 3. Initialize This Repository

```bash
cd /Users/riteshchawla/RC/git/git-for-dba

# Check current status
git status

# Add all the learning materials
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add Git learning materials"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your First Exercise (15 minutes)

Let's practice the basics and build up from there.

### Exercise: Create a Simple Schema with Branching

```bash
# 1. Create the initial schema
cat > database/MyFirstTable.sql << 'EOF'
-- My First Table
CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees (
    EmployeeId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
EOF

git add database/MyFirstTable.sql
git commit -m "Create Employees table"

# 2. View your commit
git log --oneline

# 3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-email

# 4. Add email column
cat > database/MyFirstTable.sql << 'EOF'
-- My First Table
CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees (
    EmployeeId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email NVARCHAR(100)
);
EOF

git add database/MyFirstTable.sql
git commit -m "Add Email column to Employees"

# 5. View the difference
git log --oneline --graph --all

# 6. Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-email

# 7. View the result
git log --oneline --graph
```

**Congratulations!** You just:
- âœ… Created a commit
- âœ… Created a feature branch
- âœ… Made changes on the branch
- âœ… Merged back to main

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Practice Ideas (5-10 minutes each)

### Practice 1: Stashing
```bash
# Make some changes without committing
echo "ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Phone NVARCHAR(20);" >> database/MyFirstTable.sql

# Stash them
git stash save "Adding phone number"

# Do something else
echo "-- Quick fix" > database/QuickFix.sql
git add database/QuickFix.sql
git commit -m "Quick fix"

# Get your work back
git stash pop
```

### Practice 2: Branching and Merging
```bash
# Create and work on a branch
git checkout -b feature/test
echo "-- Test" > test.sql
git add test.sql
git commit -m "Test commit"

# Merge it
git checkout main
git merge feature/test

# Clean up
git branch -d feature/test
```

### Practice 3: Viewing History
```bash
# Try different log views
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --graph --all
git log --stat
git log -p  # Shows full diff

# If you set up aliases:
git lg
git ll
```

### Practice 4: Undoing Changes
```bash
# Make a commit
echo "-- Mistake" > mistake.sql
git add mistake.sql
git commit -m "Oops"

# Undo it (local only - not pushed)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Check it's gone
git log --oneline
```

## ðŸ†˜ If You Get Stuck

### "I made a mistake, how do I undo it?"

```bash
# If you haven't committed: discard changes
git checkout -- <file>

# If you committed but didn't push: reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# If you pushed: revert
git revert HEAD

# Lost something? Check reflog
git reflog
```

### "I'm in the middle of something and confused"

```bash
# Check what's happening
git status

# See what you changed
git diff

# If merge/rebase conflict and want to abort
git merge --abort
git rebase --abort

# If totally lost, stash everything and start over
git stash
```

### "I want to see what command does before running it"

```bash
# Dry run (doesn't actually change anything)
git merge --no-commit --no-ff branch-name

# View what would happen
git log main..feature-branch  # Commits that would merge
git diff main...feature-branch  # Changes that would merge
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for DBAs

### 1. Name branches clearly
```bash
# Good branch names
git checkout -b feature/add-customer-indexes
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-deadlock
git checkout -b refactor/optimize-stored-procs
```

### 2. Write good commit messages
```bash
# Good commit message format
git commit -m "Add missing index on Orders.CustomerId

- Resolves query timeout issues on customer report
- Expected to improve query performance by 80%
- Tested on staging environment with production data sample"
```

### 3. Use branches for different database environments
```bash
# Example workflow
main             # Production schema
â”œâ”€ develop       # Development schema
â”œâ”€ staging       # Staging schema
â””â”€ feature/*     # Feature branches
```

### 4. Commit migration scripts with version numbers
```bash
database/
â”œâ”€ migrations/
â”‚   â”œâ”€ 001_create_tables.sql
â”‚   â”œâ”€ 002_add_indexes.sql
â”‚   â”œâ”€ 003_create_stored_procs.sql
```

### 5. Use .gitignore for environment-specific files
```bash
# Create .gitignore
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Connection strings
*connection*.config
*.env

# Backup files
*.bak

# Temp files
*.tmp
~$*
EOF

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore for sensitive files"
```

## âœ… Checklist: Am I Ready?

Before diving into the lessons, make sure:

- [ ] Git is installed (`git --version` works)
- [ ] Git is configured (name and email set)
- [ ] You're in the git-for-dba directory
- [ ] You've made your first commit
- [ ] You can view logs (`git log` shows commits)

- [ ] (Optional) Merge tool configured ([Merge Tools Guide](docs/MERGE-TOOLS.md))

If all checked, **you're ready to start [Lesson 1](lessons/01-git-stash.md)!**

## ðŸŽ¯ What Will You Master?

By completing this training, you'll be able to:

### After Core Lessons (1-7)
- âœ… Handle any merge conflict confidently
- âœ… Rebase and clean up commit history
- âœ… Use stash effectively for context switching
- âœ… Choose the right merge strategy
- âœ… Undo mistakes safely (reset vs revert)
- âœ… Cherry-pick commits across branches

### After Advanced Lessons (8-10)
- âœ… Debug issues by finding the problematic commit (bisect)
- âœ… Automate validation with pre-commit hooks
- âœ… Recover "lost" commits from disasters
- âœ… Remove sensitive data from Git history
- âœ… Use reflog to time-travel through Git history

### After Supplementary Materials
- âœ… Resolve conflicts with visual merge tools
- âœ… Work on multiple branches simultaneously (worktrees)
- âœ… Collaborate effectively in multi-developer teams
- âœ… Handle emergency hotfixes without losing flow
- âœ… Conduct code reviews without context switching

**You'll go from Git novice to Git power user!**

## ðŸŽŠ Final Encouragement

Git has a learning curve, but it's worth it! Here's what to remember:

1. **Make mistakes** - Git is forgiving. Most things can be undone.
2. **Practice regularly** - 15 minutes a day beats 2 hours once a week.
3. **Use it for real work** - The best way to learn is by doing.
4. **Don't memorize** - Keep the quick reference handy.
5. **Experiment** - Create a test repo and try things out.

The reflog (`git reflog`) is your safety net - you can almost always recover from mistakes!

**Ready to begin? Start with [Lesson 1: Git Stash](lessons/01-git-stash.md)**

Have questions? Stuck on something? That's normal! Git takes time to master, but every DBA who uses it wonders how they ever worked without it.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
